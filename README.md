First of all, if you are not familiar with the Battleship game, read about it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). The game will be played among two players (two instances of your program) over the local area network. Your game will be all (colored) text based (no need for fancy graphics). There will be four ships to start with on each side.

First run Server.java

To change ip address, change the IP variable from network.Client.java

Then run GUITest.java for client1
Again run GUITest.java for client2
